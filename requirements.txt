# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Core Requirements for PySpeed Analysis Engine
#
# These packages are essential for the non-GUI parts of the application,
# including the Jupyter magic and the core optimization logic.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to source code conversion. A fallback to
# the built-in `ast.unparse` is available for Python 3.9+, but astor is
# often preferred for its formatting.
astor>=0.8.1

# For running the Jupyter/IPython magic command (`%%pyspeed`).
ipython>=7.0.0

# For the optional (opt-in) telemetry feature to send anonymous usage data.
requests>=2.25.0


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GUI Requirements
#
# This package is required ONLY to run the pyspeed_gui.py application.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The modern and themeable UI toolkit used for the desktop application.
customtkinter>=5.2.0


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# High-Performance Backends (Highly Recommended)
#
# These are the libraries that PySpeed uses to actually accelerate code.
# The tool will run without them but will not be able to apply optimizations.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The core Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for accelerating numeric code.
# PySpeed's primary optimization strategy relies on this.
numba>=0.58.0

# The fundamental package for scientific computing. Required by Numba and
# used in many test cases. Version <2 is recommended for broad compatibility
# with other scientific libraries like SciPy.
numpy<2.0.0

# A powerful data analysis library. Used as a "gold standard" benchmark in the
# time series test case and commonly found in code that PySpeed would analyze.
pandas>=1.5.0


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional Test Case Dependencies
#
# These packages are not required for PySpeed to function but are needed
# to run all the provided test case scripts (e.g., image_convolution.py).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Python Imaging Library, used for loading/saving images in the
# image convolution test case.
Pillow>=9.0.0
